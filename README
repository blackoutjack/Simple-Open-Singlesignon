Description:
This module is created as an original project for CS838 - Applied Cryptography taught by Professor Tom Ristenpart at the UW-Madison Computer Sciences department. The goal is to synthesize ideas from prior efforts such as the Single Sign-on module (http://drupal.org/project/sso) and Fierce SSO (http://drupal.org/project/fierce_sso) to create a more robust and performant single sign-on implementation.

The initial phase of development will focus on the case in which two websites share a single database and use the domain access module to host multiple 2nd-level domains. (The phrase "2nd-level domain" refers to "example" in the URL "http://www.example.com/". Due to cross-domain cookie restrictions imposed by browsers, this is a substantially trickier prospect than conducting single sign-on across subdomains that share a common 2nd-level domain.)

Infrastructure is also being created to facilitate the eventual coordination of SOS across domains that do not share a database or file system.
